# b-ost, a fun project ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-blue) ![NASM](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembler-NASM-blue) 


I do not remember how I stumbled upon [Nick Blundell's book](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf), but one thing is certain: I fell in love with it. 

I always wanted to start programming something that would be considered low-level but I never knew how to do it; I did not know assembly at all, but this book really helped me understand it better and...bonus points: 
* I am able to put this knowledge into something really cool! (at least for me)
